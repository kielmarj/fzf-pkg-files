`fzf-pkg-files` is a user-friendly Bash script that leverages `fzf` to browse and preview all files installed by a pacman-managed package. This tool is particularly useful for Arch Linux users who want to quickly locate and inspect files associated with a specific package.

`fzf-pkg-files` is straightforward and easy to use. It only requires a single argument: either the name of an installed package, or the name of an installed command.

3. **Optionally, move the script to a directory in your PATH**

### Dependencies

***Required***<br>
Ensure the following dependencies are installed on your system:
* [`fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) - A command-line fuzzy finder.
* [`pacman`](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/pacman/pacman) - The package manager for Arch Linux.
* [`bat`](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) - A `cat(1)` clone with wings.

***Optional***<br>
The following tools are optional but recommended for optimal file previews:
* [`kitty`](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty) - Cross-platform, fast, feature-rich, GPU-based terminal. Used by `fzf-pkg-files` to generate image previews.
* [`html-to-markdown`](https://github.com/JohannesKaufmann/html-to-markdown?tab=readme-ov-file) - Convert HTML to Markdown. Even works with entire websites and can be extended through rules.
* [`zcat`](https://www.gnu.org/software/gzip/) - Provided by the `gzip` package. Used by `fzf-pkg-files` to render previews of `Info files`.
* [`pdftotext`](https://github.com/jalan/pdftotext) - Simple PDF text extraction.

## Usage

To use `fzf-pkg-files`, simply run the script followed by the name of an installed package or command:
```bash
fzf-pkg-files <NAME OF INSTALLED PACMAN-MANAGED PACKAGE -OR- COMMAND>
```
In `fzf`, use <kbd>TAB</kbd> to select multiple files, <kbd>ENTER</kbd> to open selected files in a pager, & <kbd>ESC</kbd> to exit `fzf` & print selected file paths to `stdout`.

### Extending File Previews

To support additional file types or tweak an existing preview, edit the `get_preview_command` function in `fzf-pkg-files`:
1. Add a new `elif` condition based on the file extension, MIME type, or encoding.
2. Use `bat` or another tool for previewing.

Example for `.log` files:
```bash
elif [[ "$file" =~ \.log$ ]]; then
    bat --language=log "$file"
```
